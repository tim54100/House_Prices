# House_Prices
Use data in train.csv to predict house_price in test.csv.

The dataset is from kaggle's competition, [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

It was a practice before I work for my job now.

I almost use [the kernel's code](https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard) in kaggle.

I just studied code and presented to others at that time.
